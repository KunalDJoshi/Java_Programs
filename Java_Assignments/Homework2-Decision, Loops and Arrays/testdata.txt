Test Data 1:-

firstNum=8, secondNum=2, thirdNum=6

First conditional check:
is firstNum<secondNum?
No,so according to flow chart, 
Second conditional check:
is secondNum<thirdNum?
Yes,so according to flow chart, 
Third conditional check:
is firstNum<thirdNum?
No,so according to flow chart, values are ordered as:
secondNum,thirdNum,firstNum
i.e., 2,6,8



Test Data 2:-

firstNum=2, secondNum=3, thirdNum=8

First conditional check:
is firstNum<secondNum?
Yes,so according to flow chart,
Second conditional check:
is firstNum<thirdNum?
Yes,so according to flow chart,
is secondNum<thirdNum?
Yes,so according to flow chart, values are ordered as:
firstNum,secondNum,thirdNum
i.e., 2,3,8
